Check‑in using the digital/keyless system is mixed to negative — some find the app convenient but others experienced confusing instructions or malfunctioning electronic keys. Room impressions are mixed: the living areas are often fine, but bedrooms can feel small and a few guests noted minor maintenance or missing supplies (coffee pods, damaged appliances). Accessibility is a clear downside — stairs and limited lift access bother many — and noise can be an issue near the church and busy streets.","The apartment earns strong praise for its central, walkable location and overall cleanliness, but several practical drawbacks recur: accessibility is a clear downside—guests frequently complain about steep narrow stairs or a lift that only starts on the first floor, an issue raised far more often than at other hotels in this area. App-based keyless entry, slow or confusing check‑in/payment procedures, and occasional missing arrival information (including Wi‑Fi details) drew mixed-to-negative comments more often than at nearby hotels. Room size and in-room facilities split opinion—some find the space well equipped, others note small bedrooms, missing coffee pods or worn items—and noise from church bells or neighboring guests was also reported. Staff friendliness and breakfast are less often praised here than at nearby hotels."

In-room facilities—secure lockers, individual plugs and a well-equipped communal kitchen—also receive far more positive attention than at other hotels in the area, and linens and towels are repeatedly noted as fresh. Staff are generally friendly, while bathrooms receive mixed reviews (small showers, wet floors). Early check-in restrictions are mentioned more often and frustrate some guests. The layout balances privacy and storage, though bathroom placement can be disruptive.

On the downside, responsiveness to requests, room air‑conditioning/temperature control and Wi‑Fi reliability attract more complaints than is typical at other hotels in Bilbao, and dining prices are often seen as high. Several areas commonly highlighted at nearby hotels—speed of service, in‑room facilities, perceived value, proximity to restaurants/beach and overall cleanliness—are mentioned less here, so check these specifics if they matter to you."
967939350,Spain City.xlsx,"Guests praise the property for its well-equipped rooms and communal facilities—especially the large shared kitchen, in‑room fridges and convenient laundry—so room amenities are a clear positive. Location and overall atmosphere also rate very highly, with many enjoying the central, old‑town setting and welcoming vibe, and staff are consistently helpful. Perceived value is mixed: many find it good for the area, though a few consider it pricey. The main downsides are comfort issues: several guests reported noise (including nearby building work) and inadequate window coverings or an always‑on emergency light that prevent full darkness.","Guests praise the central location, pleasant atmosphere and helpful staff, and the property's in-room kitchens and laundry facilities receive much more praise than at other hotels in this district. The hotel is also frequently described as newly renovated and especially safe for solo travelers—more so than nearby hotels. However, noise, weak internal soundproofing and persistent light issues in rooms are noted more often here than at similar hotels. Value opinions are mixed; Wi‑Fi and multilingual reception get some positive mentions. Unlike other hotels in the area, breakfast, air‑conditioning, views, bed comfort and proximity to shops are rarely discussed, so they may not be a standout."

-1225085685,Spain City.xlsx,"Guests praise the unbeatable central location—within easy walking distance of the city center and main attractions—and the roomy, well-equipped apartments with a good shower and useful kitchen appliances. However, noise can be an issue for light sleepers, with occasional metro rumble, street activity and nearby parties reported. The biggest downside is accessibility: there is no lift and reaching the flat requires climbing many stairs, which can be difficult with luggage. Overall it’s a spacious, conveniently located option for sightseers who don’t mind stairs and potential urban noise.","Guests praise spacious, well‑equipped rooms with good bathrooms, and private balconies/terraces and Wi‑Fi are often singled out positively; terraces receive noticeably more praise than at other hotels in this area. Noise is mentioned far more than at other hotels in this area—metro rumble, parties and neighbouring-apartment noise can disturb light sleepers.
